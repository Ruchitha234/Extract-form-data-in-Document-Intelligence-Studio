# Extract-form-data-in-Document-Intelligence-Studio

Document Intelligence Studio is a powerful tool for extracting data from forms using advanced AI models. Hereâ€™s how you can get started:

Steps to Extract Form Data
Access Document Intelligence Studio:
Sign in to Document Intelligence Studio.

Create a New Project:
Start a new project and select the type of document you want to analyze (e.g., invoices, receipts, business cards).

Upload Your Documents:
Upload the forms or documents you want to extract data from. You can use sample documents provided by the platform or your own files.

Choose the Model:
Select a prebuilt model like the Invoice or Receipt model, or create a custom model tailored to your specific form types.

Train Custom Models:
If using custom models, label the fields you want to extract (e.g., date, total amount, vendor name) and train the model with your labeled data.

Run the Analysis:
Use the trained model to analyze your documents. The model will extract key-value pairs, tables, and other relevant data.

Review and Export Results:
Review the extracted data directly in the studio. You can export the results in various formats (e.g., JSON, CSV) for further use.

Key Features
Prebuilt Models: Quickly get started with models designed for common document types like invoices and receipts.

Custom Models: Train models to handle specific forms and extract the exact fields you need.

High Accuracy: Benefit from advanced machine learning algorithms that ensure high accuracy in data extraction.

Interactive Interface: Use the visual interface to label data, train models, and review results without writing code.
